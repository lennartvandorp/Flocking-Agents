<h1>Flocking agents</h1>
  <p>
The Flocking Agents project was made for an assignment at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. It uses the Boids algorithm as a base to simulate hundreds of agents moving through an environment all at once. 
  Added to this was obstacle avoidance, which meant that the agents would actually navigate through the environment, the player would also leave scent nodes on the ground that the agents would follow. </p>
